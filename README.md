# Creation of Light Field data and Image reconstruction
This project provides MATLAB scripts to create light field data from camera captired images
## Features  of the project
* Creation light field data for each camera image
* Apply it to the same algorithm to mutlple orientations
* Reconstruct image from the complete light field data created
